If you're reading this topic, chances are you're tasked with mentoring someone. Maybe this is part of your job, or maybe this is something you're doing for a friend or colleague. In fact, you can even mentor your peers- as long as you have something to teach, and the ability to listen, you can be a mentor.

This course is built to introduce you to some useful techniques and best practices around mentorship, and help you get the most out of mentoring someone. Teaching something to another person is one of the deepest forms of learning that you can do, so consider it to be a part of your lifelong continuing education.
