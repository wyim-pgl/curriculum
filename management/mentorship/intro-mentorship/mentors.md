## Content

Becoming a mentor means entering an important, potentially transformative relationship with another person, and building upon that relationship over time. The key components of a mentorship relationship are:

* Trust
* Mutual respect
* Psychological safety
* Mutual interests
* Discipline and commitment

*Trust* and *mutual respect* is important because without it, someone cannot learn from you. If your mentee does not have trust in you, they will not be able to take your advice. If your advice goes against their intuition, it doesn't make sense to take it without these important relationship factors. Once you establish trust and mutual respect, it is imperative that you maintain it in order to continue being a mentor.

*Psychological safety* is a key ingredient in any learning experience. Anyone learning something new must leave their comfort zone to do so. In order to learn, one must be comfortable making mistakes. The easier it is to make a mistake, the easier it is to correct that mistake and so, learn from it. Without mistakes, what is learned is easily forgotten. If your mentee feels safe coming to you with their rough drafts and feels you will accept their mistakes as a part of the process, you will have greater visibility into their learning and will be able to provide clearer guidance.

*Mutual interests* are how you establish the focus of your mentorship relationship. A focused mentorship relationship vastly improves the outcomes of that relationship. Most mentorship relationships don't touch every aspect of a person's life- often you are mentoring someone in your field of expertise, or on their career or emotional path. It's rare to see a mentorship relationship succeed when the mentor can't focus on a few facets of someone's life to improve. That said, there are some foundational skills that mentors sometimes must build in order to build the skills their mentorship focuses on.

The last factor is *discipline* and *commitment*. Without mutual discipline on the part of the mentor and the mentee, the relationship will not be fruitful. Mentors and mentees must meet regularly, and mentees must follow up on the commitments they have made to their mentors. Mentors must draw strong boundaries with mentees who do not meet the discipline and commitment requirements for the relationship, otherwise mentees will not learn to value the connection.
