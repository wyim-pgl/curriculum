# What is Python?

---
## Content

Python is a *high-level*, *interpreted*, *interactive* and *object-oriented* programming language.

That means it's designed to be easily readable, using English keywords and straightforward syntax. For example, here's how you could log text to the shell with Python:

```python
print ('Learning Python with Enki!')
```
Python is processed at runtime by the *interpreter*, which means that Python programs don't need to be compiled pre-execution. This makes them simple to change, and easy to get started. You can run this interpreter in _interactive mode_ like this:

```bash
python -i
```

UNIX-based operating systems even come with Python pre-installed, meaning you can probably run it from a shell with this command:

```bash
python my_program.py
```

If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
